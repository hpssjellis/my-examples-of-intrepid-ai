# Downloads (Not officially released yet):

Always best to get downloads from the official site, but today i could not find them.

Note: My Windows anitivirus did not like these, I needed to tell it to ignore them which is probably not a really good idea.

Note: On Linux the sim I just clicked on and it worked, the agent I had to open a terminal and type ```./intrepid-agent```
