Here are the simplest installation instructions for basic ROS 2 functionality on Ubuntu Linux and Windows.

Ubuntu Linux (22.04 LTS recommended)
1. Set up sources and keys
Open a terminal and run:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y curl gnupg2 lsb-release
sudo curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.key | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg > /dev/null
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg] http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2.list > /dev/null
2. Install ROS 2 Base
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y ros-humble-ros-base
("ros-base" provides core ROS 2 tools without extra GUI tools like RViz or Gazebo.)

3. Set up environment
Add ROS 2 to your shell profile:

bash
Copy
Edit
echo "source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
4. Test Installation
Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker
Then, in a new terminal, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
ros2 run demo_nodes_py listener
If you see messages being sent and received, your ROS 2 installation is working.

Windows (Easiest Setup)
1. Install Dependencies
Download and install Chocolatey (if not already installed).
Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:
powershell
Copy
Edit
choco install -y git cmake python3 curl
2. Install ROS 2
Download ROS 2 Humble (Base).
Extract the zip file to C:\ros2_humble.
3. Set up environment
Open PowerShell and run:

powershell
Copy
Edit
$env:Path += ";C:\ros2_humble\bin"
echo 'source C:\ros2_humble\setup.bat' >> $PROFILE
Restart PowerShell to apply changes.

4. Test Installation
Run:

powershell
Copy
Edit
ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker
Then, in a new PowerShell window, run:

powershell
Copy
Edit
ros2 run demo_nodes_py listener
If you see messages being sent and received, ROS 2 is working!

This setup gives you basic ROS 2 functionality with the ability to run nodes and communicate. Let me know if you need additional configurations like USB device support for ESP32-S3! ðŸš€
